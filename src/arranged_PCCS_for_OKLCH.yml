arranged_PCCS_for_OKLCH:
  # Cmax: the maximum of chroma
  # C8: (8 / 9) * Cmax, round to the fourth decimal place
  # C5: (5 / 9) * Cmax, round to the fourth decimal place
  # C2: (2 / 9) * Cmax, round to the fourth decimal place
  # L(C)max: the maximum of lightness as chroma = C
  # L(C)min: the minimum of lightness as chroma = C
  # L(C)high: {2 * L(C2)min + 5 * L(C2)max} / 7, {L(C5)min + 3 * L(C5)max} / 4, round to the second decimal place
  # L(C)medium: {L(C)min + L(C)max} / 2, round to the third second place
  # L(C)low: {5 * L(C2)min + 2 * L(C2)max} / 7, {3 * L(C5)min + L(C5)max} / 4, round to the third second place
